# 3. Development of my website and knowledge
My project has undergone a significant change from my initial idea, and it now looks completely different from what I had imagined. I never expected it to turn out this beautifully. I want to express my gratitude to Laura for explaining everything in such a clear and understandable way. I had absolutely no prior experience, and thanks to this course, I am leaving with a wealth of new knowledge. Countless thanks to you!
